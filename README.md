- 👋 Hi, I am Mika, a.k.a. @Lemonatix
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, Chemistry and of course a bit of programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, dart and C++ as programming languages and I am currently building my own website with html, css and javascript.
- I'll be looking forward to expanding my programming knowledge here and learning with a lot of fun projects!
