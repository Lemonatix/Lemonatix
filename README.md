- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Mika, a.k.a. @Lemonatix
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Physics, Chemistry and of course a bit of programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, dart and C++ as programming languages and I am already quite familiar with ArduinoCode.
- I'll be looking forward to expanding my programming knowledge here and learning with a lot of fun projects!
