- Hi, I am Mika, a.k.a. @Lemonatix
- I’m interested in Physics, Chemistry and of course programming.
- I’m currently learning python, dart and C++ as programming languages and I am currently building my own website with html, css and javascript.
- I'll be looking forward to expanding my programming knowledge here and learning with a lot of fun projects!
